NumPy and SciPy wheels linked against Intel's high performance
[oneMLK](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl.html)
BLAS and LAPACK libraries for Intel CPUs. The wheels are available from a Python Package
Index URL for convenient installation with `pip` or `uv`.

## Installation

## Alternatives

- The `conda-forge` and `anaconda` conda channels contain comparable NumPy and SciPy
builds. The main benefit of this index is that it eliminates the dependence on a conda,
allowing to install high performance scientific computing libraries with the convenience
of `pip` or `uv`.
- Intel's own Python Package Index contains similar wheels for NumPy releases `<= 1.26`.
