### Usage

The release assets below aren't intended to be installed in isolation. To work correctly, one must
install compatible, mkl-accelerated versions of `numpy`, `mkl-service` and, if needed, `scipy`. It
is highly recommended to use `pip` or `uv` to automatically handle all dependencies. E.g.,
```shell
pip install numpy scipy --extra-index-url https://urob.github.io/numpy-mkl
```
See the [setup guide](https://github.com/urob/numpy-mkl#installation) for additional instructions.

If a manual installation is required, current wheels for all packages and versions can be be
[downloaded here](https://urob.github.io/numpy-mkl/).  (Attached below are *newly* build wheels
only).
